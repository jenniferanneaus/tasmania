                Tasmania is the most geographically diverse state in Australia, with over 40 percent reserved as national parks and World Heritage areas.<sup>[1]</sup> An outstanding variety of flora and fauna can be found there, including glow worm caves, dramatic mountain peaks and spectacular bays. Tasmania is home to some of the most ancient plant species on Earth,<sup>[1]</sup> and boasts one of the last remaining expanses of temperate rainforest.<sup>[2]</sup>

                In addition to its natural habitats, Tasmania contains unique archaeological sites that provide important examples of human history. Some of the oldest rock marking sites in the world can be found here; along with middens, shelters and artefacts, these help us understand human life dating back to the last Ice Age.<sup>[3]</sup>

                Due to Tasmania's natural habitat and relative lack of introduced predators, many rare and endangered species survive on the island. It accommodates the three largest extant marsupial predators, including the Tasmanian devil (pictured above). This species, as well as more obscure animals like the bettong and pademelon, can only be found in the wild in Tasmania.<sup>[4]</sup>

            <p>
                A diverse array of life can also be found in Tasmanian waters, including approximately 40 species of whales and dolphins.<sup>[4]</sup> Little penguins are a delight to behold, and unusual creatures such as weedy seadragons and platypus are very special to see.

                Tasmania offers outdoor experiences to suit all levels of fitness, from fishing and golfing to kayaking and rock climbing. Russell Falls, one of Tasmania's most photographed places, is a 10 minute walk suitable for strollers and some wheelchair users. In contrast, the Overland Track is a 65km, 6 day hike through rainforests, meadows, moorlands, eucalypt forests and valleys carved by glaciers.<sup>[1]</sup>

                Around the coast, Tasmania has many great places for snorkelling or diving. Ethical tours guarantee seal sightings, and help fund private rehabilitation work for orphaned and injured wildlife. For thrill seekers, white water rafting and zipline adventures are available, as well as a high ropes course that will see you swinging, climbing, jumping and flying through the forest.

                If you prefer a more leisurely pace, you could take a stroll through the beautiful Botanical Gardens or visit one of the lavender farms. Alternatively, view the landscape from above via hot air balloon, seaplane or chairlift. There are also eco tours available, where you can see rare seabirds, seals and other marine life in their natural habitat.

                Tasmania is an excellent location for wineries, and there are wine routes to follow all over the state. Boutique breweries produce cider, whisky and gin too. In the north of the state, visit the House of Anvers to try their delicious chocolate confectionery or try Ashgrove for award-winning cheese, ice-cream and other dairy products. Seasonal events include food and wine festivals as well as cultural festivals and sporting occasions.
